# ⚙️ DevOps & Deployment Projects

This repository contains **DevOps-focused coursework and practical experiments** demonstrating how software applications are **built, deployed, configured, tested, and run** in a Linux environment.

The projects complement my backend development work by showing hands-on exposure to **automation, containerization, and deployment workflows** commonly used in modern software teams.
